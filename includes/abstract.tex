Evolutionary psychology suggests that different strategies for performing evolutionarily important tasks shaped our personality differences. But what these strategies are remain guesswork. Here, we apply Pareto Task Inference to infer the strategies and their behavioral correlates. We find the same six personality archetypes to consistently emerge from archetypal analysis applied to a diverse selection of datasets describing personality of millions in broad western culture. Enrichment of demographic attributes, personality facets, values and behavior near the archetypes reveal behavioral strategies, some of which are mentioned in the literature. We test how well distance from personality archetypes can be predicted for individuals using behavioral data, and compare the resulting accuracy to that of prediction models for Big Five traits and Big Five questionnaire inventory principal components. We find that distance from personality archetypes can be predicted more accurately than the other personality targets. Based on the findings and supported by literature in evolutionary psychology we argue that personality archetypes can be viewed as fundamental behavioral strategies.
