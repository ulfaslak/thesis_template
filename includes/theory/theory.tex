This chapter introduces the most relevant theory used in the current study. It first examines the concept of \textit{personality} in evolutionary psychology, giving an account of the related field personality psychology from which it uses many ideas. It then introduces the reader to the Pareto Task Inference principle which is the fundamental research paradigm on which this study is based. Although a large number of computational tools from machine learning, and concepts from statistics are used in the analysis, this chapter does not treat them because, although important to understand for the purpose of usage, they are not a central part of the research problem. For reference on topics in machine learning used in this thesis the reader is referred to \cite{bishop2006pattern}.
