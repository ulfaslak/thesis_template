\subparagraph*{Indicator} High-level unit of behavior measured in the data. Practically interchangable with what is commonly referred to as a \textit{feature} in statistics and machine learning, but is called indicator, because behavior is dynamic and can thus only be quantified as an indication, not a feature which linguistically is something more static.
\subparagraph*{Conversation} Set of interactions (\texttt{text}, \texttt{call}, \texttt{F2F}) grouped by max. time distance criteria. For \texttt{text} this forms intuitive text conversations, and similarly for \texttt{call} it corresponds to missed calls returned a short time after but could potentially be an indefinite series of back and forth calls. For \texttt{F2F} a \textit{conversation} corresponds to the physical co-presence over a period of time. \textit{Conversations} are strictly between two individuals.
