The myPersonality research project maintained a Facebook application through which users could answer various personality questionnaires and donate personal data from their profiles\mcite{kosinski2015facebook}. It reached great popularity because it allowed users to compare results with friends and even fill out personality questionnaires for others. From 2007 to 2012 the research project managed to collect questionnaire responses from nearly 7.5 million Facebook users. 900.000 users retook the questionnaire providing longitudinal data, 300.000 provided friend ratings enabling self-report accuracy assessment and 40\% gave full access to private profile information.

In the current study, access to approximately 2.5 million BF profiles and 9000 'Basic Human Values' (BHV) questionnaire responses were provided. BHVs stem from the Theory of Basic Human Values due to Shalom Schwartz\mcite{schwartz1992universals, schwartz2012overview}, which juxtapose the 10 fundamental values: \textit{benevolence}, \textit{tradition}, \textit{conformity}, \textit{security}, \textit{power}, \textit{achievement}, \textit{hedonism}, \textit{stimulation}, \textit{self-direction}, \textit{universalism}. An overview of value/facet-relationships of their position relative to each other is given in Appendix \ref{app:theoryOfBasicHumanValues}.
