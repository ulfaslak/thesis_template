Four different datasources are used in this study. Each one contains multiple datasets and are used for slightly different purposes. Table \ref{tab:dataSourceOverview} gives an overview of which datatypes each source provides. They all have in common that they provide Big Five data for a large number of survey responders which is useful for the analysis presented in Section \ref{subsec:consensusArchetypes}. Appendix \ref{app:BFdist} gives a comparative overview of all Big Five datasets.

	\caption{\label{tab:dataSourceOverview} Overview of the types of data contained in each used dataset. '\OK' symbolizes that the source contains a given type, and if there are multiple it means that the source contains multiple sets of the type. '-' symbolizes that the type is contained in the datasource but is not used in the analysis.}
