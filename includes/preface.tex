This thesis was submitted as a final requirement for obtaining the degree of Master of Digital Media Engineering (cand. polyt.) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It was carried out from january to july of 2016 as a collaboration between the Uri Alon Lab, at the Weizmann Institute of Science (WIS) in Israel, and the Social Fabric project at University of Copenhagen and DTU Compute. Throughout the project I lived in Israel and appeared in the lab where I, aside from conducting my own research, participated in group meetings, project sparing, and various other research activities. The project was mainly supervised by Uri Alon (Professor, WIS, Dept. of Molecular Cell Biology) and Sune Lehmann (Associate Professor, DTU, DTU Compute). Hila Sheftel and Pablo Szekely (PhD students, WIS, Dept. of Molecular Cell Biology) also took part in supervising and mentoring. 

I want to thank Uri for actively engaging in my work with childlike curiosity and genuine interest, and for never failing to identify the paths to the most interesting research objectives. I thank Sune for always believing in me and my motivations, for facilitating the whole arrangement and for his infinite resource of spirit. I thank Hila and Pablo for invaluable scientific guidance and mentoring, Avi Mayo for technical discussions of various sorts, all the members of the Theatre Lab for inspiration and enlightenment, and everyone in the Uri Alon Lab for accepting me as a member of their nurturing research environment. I also thank my dear friend Daniel Svendsen for endless videocall discussions about the hardship of research and the meaning of life.

For economical support I want to thank Oticon Fonden, Reinholdt W. Jorck og Hustrus Fond, Ingeni\o rforeningen i Danmarks og Berg-Nielsens Studie- og St\o ttefond, KnuH\o jgaards Fond, Dansk Tennisfond, Otto M\o nsteds Fond and Dansk-Israelsk Studiefond.

Finally, I thank Vivi Lai for her tremendous courage and faith, and for letting me travel so far away for so long and still be right there, in the hammock by the window, upon my return.
