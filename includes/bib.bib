  abstract = {The era of big data has created new opportunities for researchers to achieve high relevance and impact amid changes and transformations in how we study social science phenomena. With the emergence of new data collection technologies, advanced data mining and analytics support, there seems to be fundamental changes that are occurring with the research questions we can ask, and the research methods we can apply. The contexts include social networks and blogs, political discourse, corporate announcements, digital journalism, mobile telephony, home entertainment, online gaming, financial services, online shopping, social advertising, and social commerce. The changing costs of data collection and the new capabilities that researchers have to conduct research that leverages micro-level, meso-level and macro-level data suggest the possibility of a scientific paradigm shift toward computational social science. The new thinking related to empirical regularities analysis, experimental design, and longitudinal empirical research further suggests that these approaches can be tailored for rapid acquisition of big data sets. This will allow business analysts and researchers to achieve frequent, controlled and meaningful observations of real-world phenomena. We discuss how our philosophy of science should be changing in step with the times, and illustrate our perspective with comparisons between earlier and current research inquiry. We argue against the assertion that theory no longer matters and offer some new research directions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We first examine a number of different parametric and nonparametric estimators (some known and some new), including the "plug-in" method, several versions of Lempel-Ziv-based compression algorithms, a maximum likelihood estimator tailored to renewal processes, and the natural estimator derived from the Context-Tree Weighting method (CTW). The theoretical properties of these estimators are examined, several new theoretical results are developed, and all estimators are systematically applied to various types of synthetic data and under different conditions. Our main focus is on the performance of these entropy estimators on the (binary) spike trains of 28 neurons recorded simultaneously for a one-hour period from the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of a monkey. We show how the entropy estimates can be used to test for the existence of longterm structure in the data, and we construct a hypothesis test for whether the renewal process model is appropriate for these spike trains. Further, by applying the CTW algorithm we derive the maximum a posterior (MAP) tree model of our empirical data, and comment on the underlying structure it reveals. © 2006 IEEE.},

Simple activities may last just a few seconds, e. g., walking, running, resting, etc. whereas complex activities involve a combination of the former and they may last from a few minutes to several hours. In this work long-term activity recognition is performed and modeled as a distribution of simple activities represented as a histogram. For the experiments, the raw histograms were used for the recognition task and then we added an additional step which consists of extracting features over the histogram and applying a simple threshold to reduce noise. This additional step resulted in an increase on the classification accuracy. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and peer-review under responsibility of CIIECC 2013},

We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fitsall stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81% and 76% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, StressSense represents the first system to consider voice based stress detection and model adaptation in diverse real-life conversational situations using smartphones.

Moreover, the system is programmable by means of a declarative language that can be used to express adaptive rules to improve power saving. We evaluate a system prototype on Nokia Symbian phones by means of several small-scale experiments aimed at testing performance in terms of accuracy and power consumption. Finally, we present the results of real deployment where we study participants emotions and interactions. We cross-validate our measurements with the results obtained through questionnaires filled by the users, and the results presented in social psychological studies using traditional methods.

Abstract = {Intercorrelations among ratings on 35 personality traits, selected as representative of the personality domain, were obtained for eight samples. These samples differed in length of acquaintanceship from 3 days to more than a year; in kind of acquaintanceship from assessment programs in a military training course to a fraternity house situation; in type of subject from airmen with only a high-school education to male and female undergraduate students to first-year graduate students; and in type of rater from very naive persons to clinical psychologists and psychiatrists with years of experience in the evaluation of personality. Centroid or multiple-group factors were extracted and rotated orthogonally to simple structure. For one study, an independent solution was obtained in which analytic rotations were accomplished on an IBM 650 computer using Kaiser's normal varimax criterion. Five fairly strong and recurrent factors emerged from each analysis, labeled as (a) Surgency, (b) Agreeabl},

We identify three descriptive and explanatory languages in the field and critique them from the perspective of scholarship outside of psychology that has explored language use.
